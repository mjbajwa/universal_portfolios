# Modern Portfolio Theory

## Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization

- Sharpe and Markowitz (1960s), based on Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- Maximize expected arithmetic return subject to a variance constraint (in a fixed window)
- Modern portfolio theory tries to estimate expected return mean and variance of various stocks
-- Implicit in this assumption is that the return distribution is *Gaussian*, the mean and variance of which are estimated from empirical history of a stock
- These estimates are inputs into an optimization model that allocates a portfolio subject to an *overall portfolio risk
-- A rolling variance of a given stock is estimated, and used as a measure of "risk"

## Mathematical Formulation (1)

- Assumptions

- $Let \; b_i \; = \; the \; portfolio \; fraction \; invested \; in \; the \; i^{th} \; stock$ 
- $\sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i = 1$
- $Assume \; each \; stock \; is\; Gaussian \; and \; Independent: \; N(\mu_i, \sigma_i)$
- $\mu_i = mean\; expected\; return\; from\; i^{th}\; stock$
- $\sigma_i = variance\; of\; i^{th}\; stock$

## Mathematical Formulation (2)

$$maximize \; \sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i\mu_i $$
$$s.t. \; \sigma_{portfolio} < \sigma_{max}$$

## Efficient Frontier

- As you tweek desired portfolio variance, the expected return of the new portfolio will go up (high risk, high return)

## Shortcomings

- How can we make such specific distributional assumptions about the future?
- Even if we make distributional assumptions, how can we estimate the mean and variance using past data?
- Why are we only optimizing over one investment horizon? Don't returns compound?

# The Kelly Criterion

## Derivation

- Kelly Criterion doesn't get rid of distributional assumptions but instead focuses on introducing compounding and multi-horizon decision into the optimization problem

- Also known as log-optimal portfolio theory, because of the role that logarithms play

- Let's derive the criterion for a bernoulli coin-toss, with probability $p$ of heads, payoff $o$ if heads and 0 if tails. We would like to invest a fraction f of our portfolio. Assume portfolio has 1 dollar. 

## Derivation

\begin{align*}
S_{n} &= S_{o}\cdot(1 + f\cdot o)^{S}(1 - f)^{F} \\
(\frac{S_{n}}{S_{o}})^{1/n} &= (1 + f\cdot o)^{S/n}(1 - f)^{F/n} \\
\frac{1}{n} log \frac{S_{n}}{S_{o}} &= \frac{S}{n} log (1 + f\cdot o) + \frac{F}{n}log(1 - f) \\
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} log \frac{S_{n}}{S_{o}} &= p\cdot log (1 + f\cdot o) + (1-p)\cdot log(1 - f) \\
G &= p\cdot log (1 + f\cdot o) + (1-p)\cdot log(1 - f)
\end{align*}

- $G \; is \; the \; growth \; rate$
- $maximize \; G \;  \rightarrow  \; obtain \; \frac{\mathrm{d}G}{\mathrm{d} f} \; and \; set \; it \; to \; 0 \rightarrow optimal \ f^{*} is \; optimal \; allocation$

<!-- - Remember the formulation of $G$, we will come back to it. -->

# Shannon's Demon

- Maintain a constant proportion of cash and stock for any random process
- 

# Cover's Universal Portfolio

## What does it accomplish?

- Proposes a rebalancing strategy that beats the best optimally rebalanced portfolio (even in hindsight!)
- Simply put, this algorithm does as well as a lazy portfolio you might construct in hindsight that follows Shannon's demon
- The mathematical intuition required to see this was nothing short of genius
- Simple and elegant

## Optimal, Constant Rebalanced Portfolio

## Significance

- Cover (1991) proved that this algorithm asymptotically approaches **optimal, constantly rebalanced portfolio in hindsight**
- Although Cover excludes Transaction costs, it is still unclear why this isn't more popular in practice 

## Outline of Proof (Definitions)

- Assume we have m stocks, so that $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{x_{i}}$ are m-dimensional vectors representing portfolio fractions and daily wealth multiples of the stocks

- $Wealth \; after \; n \; investment \; periods$
$$S_{n}(\mathbf{b},\;\mathbf{x}^{n}) \;= \; \prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{b}^{t}\mathbf{x}_{i}$$ 
- $Wealth \; if \; using \; optimal \; constant \; rebalanced \; portfolio$
$$S_{n}^{*}(\mathbf{b^{*}},\;\mathbf{x}^{n}) \;= \; \prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{b^{*}}^{t}\mathbf{x}_{i}$$ 
- $Wealth \; if \; using \; causally \; rebalanced \; portfolio$
$$\hat{S}_{n}(\mathbf{\hat{b}},\;\mathbf{x}^{n}) \;= \; \prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{\hat{b}}^{t}\mathbf{x}_{i}$$ 

## Outline of Proof (Definition)

$$ The \; optimal \; causal \; portfolio \; is \;defined \;as: $$

$$\mathbf{\hat{b}_{i+1}}(\mathbf{x^{i}}) = \frac {\int_{b \in B} \mathbf{b}S_i(b, \mathbf{x}^{i})d\mu(\mathbf{b})}{\int {S_i(b, \mathbf{x}^{i})d\mu(\mathbf{b})}}$$

$$We \; wish \; to \; show \; \frac{\hat{S}_{n}}{{S}_{n}^{*}} \; is \; bounded$$

## Outline of Proof

- Assume $m \;= 2$ for simplicity (two stocks)
- Let's call the multiplication of the dot-product in the wealth equation **product of sums**
- We can alternatively write this **product of sums** as **sum of products**
- This converts the problem from allocating the portfolio over n investment periods, to investing in $2^{m}$ possible trajectores in **one** investment period!

## Outline of Proof

$$\prod_{i=1}^{2} \mathbf{b_{i}^{t}} \mathbf{x}_{i} = ([b_{1,1}, b_{1,2}]\cdot [x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}])([b_{2,1}, b_{2,2}]\cdot [x_{2,1}, x_{2,2}])$$
$$\prod_{i=1}^{2} \mathbf{b_{i}^{t}} \mathbf{x}_{i} = (b_{1,1}\cdot x_{1,1} + b_{1,2}\cdot x_{1,2})(b_{2,1}\cdot x_{2,1} + b_{2,2}\cdot x_{2,2})$$

<!-- b_{1,1} \cdot x_{1,1} \cdot b_{2,1} \cdot x_{2,1} + \\  -->
<!-- b_{1,1} \cdot x_{1,1} \cdot b_{2,2} \cdot x_{2,2} + \\ -->
<!-- b_{1,2} \cdot x_{1,2} \cdot b_{2,1} \cdot x_{2,1} + \\ -->
<!-- b_{1,2} \cdot x_{1,2} \cdot b_{2,2} \cdot x_{2,2}) \\ -->
- Zooming into the RHS, re-arranging and using $b_{1, i} + b_{2,i} = 1$
\begin{align*}
{\color{blue} b_{1,1} \cdot b_{2,1}} \cdot {\color{green}x_{1,1}  \cdot x_{2,1}} + \\ 
{\color{blue} b_{1,1} \cdot b_{2,2}} \cdot {\color{green}x_{1,1} \cdot x_{2,2}} + \\ 
{\color{blue} b_{1,2} \cdot b_{2,1}} \cdot {\color{green}x_{1,2} \cdot x_{2,1}} + \\
{\color{blue} b_{1,2} \cdot b_{2,2}} \cdot {\color{green}x_{1,2} \cdot x_{2,2}}
\end{align*}

- We are optimally allocating bets (in blue) over a sequence of outcomes (in green) in one investment period
- The proof rests on viewing investment in this way!
